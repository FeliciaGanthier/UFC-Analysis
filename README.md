#**UFC Fighter Analysis Project: Review**

##**Overview of Project**

Using a Kaggle dataset containing various attributes of UFC fighters, we created a pgAdmin database with SQL to store our data and attempted to predict winning fighters with machine learning. To fine tune our model’s accuracy, we used linear regression to identify the most significant variables and a Tableau dashboard to visualize interesting observations from the dataset such as countries with the most winning fighters, winning stances and winning finishes. Our final results were presented to the class using Google Slides. 

A Git Hub repository was created for the analysis so everyone in the group can contribute/review information.  The group met twice a week on Zoom to work on the project and used our team Slack channel to communicate during the week. 

##**Self-Assessment**

In **Segment 1** of our project, we preprocessed the data and decided to use feature selection to find the best attributes to explain the relationship between a fighter’s characteristics and winning matches.  As the team member in the **X Role**, I focused on the technology side of the project. I worked with my teammates to clean the data so it was appropriate for machine learning and easier to interpret. 
I also took the lead on maintaining our Read Me and began building the Google Presentation Slides. 

For **Segment 2**, I was primarily the **X Role** but also performed **Circle Role** duties while continuing to maintain our Read Me and presentation slides.  As we began to develop our dashboard, I generated images in Tableau to add to the data story being told and created images that showed winning match finishes and winning stances- reaching out to the team on Slack for feedback.

Since I was handling the writing for the team and creating on the presentation while we worked on the project, the Triangle Role in Segment 3 and the Square Role in Segment 4 were a natural fit. The team decided to use feature selection to find the best attributes to explain the relationship between a fighter’s characteristics and winning matches. A linear regression model helped us identify which variables were most significant. This removed the noise in our model but the accuracy didn’t improve so I suggested we pivot and tell the story the data was giving us. 

Time Management was my biggest challenge. I started a new job just before the project launched and juggling the new demands on my schedule was difficult because I didn’t want to let anyone down. My advice to the next cohort is to be transparent with your team, reach out to the TAs and make sure you schedule rest/self-care.

##**Team Assessment**

We created the foundation for our UFC fighter analysis project by defining roles that played to our individual strengths and establishing a communication structure. Even though we each had individual roles, our project was truly a collaborative effort. Our team pitched in to help when needed and encouraged each other every week.

Our biggest challenge came in Segment 3 when our model’s accuracy didn’t improve after using linear regression to identify the most significant variables.  While we were able to remove the noise and improve the model’s precision, we didn’t have enough data to explain the variance.  If given more time, we would add more data to the model but using datasets from other MMA leagues but I’m proud of the way the team responded and told the story we had.
